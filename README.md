# AEquilibrium - The Castle Company

### Assumptions Made

I made the assumption that the last land value could not be considered a peak or valley because you couldn't see the numbers that followed it.  Following this reasoning, I made an exception for the first land value because of the given assumption that "You can always build a castle at the start of an array".
